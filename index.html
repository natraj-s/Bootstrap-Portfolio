                                    <img src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" alt="Natraj Subramanian" id="profilepic" /> Born in India, I split my time growing up between Dubai, India, and finally the US.
                                    I was introduced to the PC in my 4th grade, but it wasn't until my uncle bought the first
                                    PC in my family sometime in '97 that I had fulltime access to it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As any other kid introduced to his/her first PC, I was fascinated by it immediately. I was inspired to explore it further
                                    than my previous usage sessions in school which only involved some brief coding with
                                    BASIC. So obviously, I gravitated towards the numerous games included with my first PC,
                                    while simultaneously expressing my creative side through MS Paint. Upon the coercion
                                    of my parents, I ended up taking my first HTML course during one of my summers in between
                                    school years.</p>
                                <p>
                                    After moving to the US however, this love for video games was further enforced as I got introduced to other game consoles.
                                    The freedom available in games like Grand Theft Auto 3 and the underlying creativity
                                    in the gameplay of games like Hitman eventually led me to majoring in Computer Science
                                    at University of Illinois at Chicago.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While working on projects during my undergrad and on projects as part of work post-graduation, one thing became immensely
                                    clear to me: I enjoyed working on the look and feel of things just as much as the technical
                                    underlyings of it. During my childhood, I used to spend my waking hours drawing and while,
                                    I may no longer be interested in pure art like I was, I never lost that creative itch.
                                    I just applied that creative side to other ventures.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, that love for meddling with both the technical and creative side of things has essentially brought me back full
                                    circle to where it all began: web development. I fully understand that at some point,
                                    I'll have to choose which side of things I really want to focus on and grown in. Until
                                    then, I'll continue to try and grow in both as much as possible.
